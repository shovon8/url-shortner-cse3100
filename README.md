# Description
This is a URL shortner app written in PHP. MySQL is used as the backend database. It is written to work with Apache 2 web server with mod_rewrite enabled. 

# Why I Made This
I just wanted to learn how to code a URL shortner. So I submitted it as my University project for the course CSE-3100.

# Configuration
1. Enter your database credentials on config/db.php file.
2. Import the assets/db.sql file into your MySQL database.
3. Enable mod_rewrite if you're using Apache 2 web server, then it should work just fine.

NOTE: Without Apache 2 mod_rewrite, the short URL redirection won't work.

Thank you!
